# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

This project uses a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model that can accurately identify items such as shirts, sneakers, and bags.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Building a neural network using Keras
- Training the model and tracking performance
- Evaluating accuracy and loss on test data
- Visualizing sample predictions

## Features

- Uses Fashion MNIST dataset of grayscale 28x28 images
- Classifies into 10 categories like T-shirt/top, Sneaker, Bag, etc.
- Neural network implementation with customizable layers
- Performance tracking with accuracy and loss plots

## How to Run

This notebook is intended for use in **Google Colab**:

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Make sure required libraries like `tensorflow` and `matplotlib` are available
3. Run all cells to execute the complete pipeline

## Output

- Accuracy and loss plots across training epochs
- Evaluation of model performance on the test set
- Sample predictions shown with corresponding labels
